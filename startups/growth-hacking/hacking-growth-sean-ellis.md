- Growth sub-teams e.g. customer retention, mobile app, international expansion etc.

- Avoid the traditional slow cycle of product concept -> development -> production -> marketing -> feedback and restart cycle

- Traditional marketing: A study found zero correlation between business growth and marketing spend

- Growth hacking is not
  - about finding a single silver bullet for growth
  - only focused on acquiring new customers; but also retain and monetising existing customers

- How the book is organised:
  - Part 1: The Method - a description of the growth hacking method
  - Part 2: The Playbook - detailed set of tactics on how to implement the method

## Chapter 2 - Determing If Your Product Is "Must-Have"
- Must not move into growth push until you know product is "must-have"

- Need to methods to dig into user behaviour to discover core value of product/service

- Establishing what core value is or should be, isn't always about identiying what the key product/service feature is, but may be connecting with the right core market (which may not be the initial market)

- Core product value isn't always what you've built or envisioned as the core value.  It may be something built into the product as an afterthought.  Whatever the case, it is up to the growth team to find out.

### What's The Aha Moment?

### Efficient Experimentation
- Experiment with both product and messaging to find the right combination of customer base and feature set you need to pass the must-have threshold
- Adopt minimum viable test (MVTs) to vet an idea, before investing in a more robust follow-on test or more polished implementation of the concept
- Keep the experitment velocity high

## Chapter 3 - Identifying Your Growth Levers

### The Metrics That Matter
- Identify a company's *fundamental growth equation*
- The way to determine your essential metrics is to identify the actions that correlate most directly to users experiencing the core value of your product
- You want to track, at a minimum, the metrics for each of the steps users must take to reach the aha moment and how often they are taking those steps
