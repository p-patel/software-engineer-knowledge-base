## Welcome to AWS
### Introduction
- ...

### Developing in the Cloud
#### Similarities
- App runs on an OS/platform
- Platform needs to be installed
- Ports need to be opened
- Connects to a database

#### Differences
- Everything locally on same machine Vs. One Service = One Responsibility
- Files stored on server Vs. Files served from S3
- Database on same server as application Vs. Database as a Service
- Connections done manually Vs. Connections done with AWS SDK

### The Web of Amazon Web Services
- Resource-based services accessed by locally-assigned IP address (or Amazon Resource Name) and port 
- Communicate with services over TCP (usually HTTP)
- Many services are founded on instances of the EC2 services

### AWS Tooling: Web Console
- Each service has its own dashboard

### AWS Tooling: CLI
- CLI supports all Web Console and SDK features

### AWS Tooling: Software Development Kits
- SDK provided as a simpler way to communicate with AWS services than just over TCP
- Multiple language SDKs available
- Course uses a Node.js project and therefore the JS SDK

### Who Luvs Pizza?
- Demo web app to be hosted on AWS
- Web app hosting - EC2
- Website assets - S3
- Users - DynamoDB
- Session cache - Elasticache
- Save created pizzas - RDS

### Installing Node.js
- Install Node.js 12

### Install the AWS CLI
- Install latest AWS CLI (may require restart to update PATH)
- `aws --version` check installation

### Creating and initialzing an AWS account
- Create AWS account
- Create AWS Access Key (can be easily created/deleted)
- `aws configure` configure AWS CLI with Access Key
- `aws ec2 describe-instances` test AWS CLI is configured with Amazon account

### Conclusion
- The AWS development experience
- The AWS web (of services)
- AWS Toolbox: Console, CLI, SDK
- Pizza demo app
- AWS dev setup

## Sounding the Alarm with IAM and Cloudwatch
### Introduction

### Cloudwatch Overview
- Monitor service resources
- Use to stop, restart, recover, scale services

### Simple Notfication Service (SNS)
- Use with Cloudwatch to send alerts by email, SMS

### Creating a CloudWatch Alarm
- Create a billing alarm to monitor estimated montlhly billing (billing alarms only available in N. Virginia region) and manage AWS costs

### Identity & Access Management Overview
- ...

### Securing Your Account
- Enable MFA

### Understanding Policies
- JSON format - effect, action, resource


### Configuring Users and Groups
- good practices: assign policies to groups and then add users to groups rather than assigning policies directly to users; use least privilege principle

### Conclusion
- ...

## Getting Inside the Virtual Machine with EC2 and VPC
### Introduction
- EC2 is fundamental to many AWS services 
- Use Elastic IPs, load balancer and auto scaling groups
- Use VPC to connect and secure resources, configure subnets, restrict access from external traffic, connect to VPNs

### VPC Overview
- Use VPCs create virtual networks to separate resources from the rest of AWS and public traffic
- Create upto 5 VPCs per account
- Use Security Groups to configure access between resources using IP addresses and ports. Configure Security Group access for other Security Groups as well as by IP addresses. Attach at the EC2 instance level
- Use Routing Tables and Network Access Control List to control traffic routing and filtering per VPC
- Assign resources to subnets within a VPC - has its own CIDR block, Routing Table and Network Access Control List
- **Subnet example:** private and public subnets, using NAT gateway to configure traffic between subnets. A private subnet will need to use a NAT Gateway on a public subnet for internet access

### Creating a VPC
- **Example:** A VPC to deploy EC2 instance, db and Elasticache instance into. This will be deployed into a VPC with 2 public subnets.  All instances will be launched into one or both of the subnets.
- VPC Overview: 1 VPC load balancer; Subnet A: EC2, Elasticache, RDS; Subnet 2: EC2; S3 (AWS Service); Dynamo DB (AWS Service)
- Use Create VPC Wizard (and see VPC Configuration options)
- Create subnet 'pizza-subnet-a' with CIDR-block 10.0.**0**.0/24
- Go to Route Table for created VPC | Routes tab
- Edit Routes | Add Route -> 0.0.0.0/0, Target -> existing Internet Gateway (VPC now has internet access)
- Will be launching apps using Auto Scaling Group; will need to know how to deploy to mulitple AZs (Availability Zones)
- A subnet only exists in a single AZ, so will need to create multiple subnets to deploy into more AZs. Create subnet 'pizza-subnet-b' in a different AZ with CIDR-block 10.0.**1**.0/24 to avoid IP address collisions with 'pizza-subnet-a' as both subnets have different IP-ranges

### Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
...

## Hosting All the Things with S3
### Introduction
- S3 using AWS SDK
- Web app updates to store/retrieve site images from S3

### S3 Overview
- Store objects in specified region
- S3 object - file + metadata
- Buckets store objects and provides a (unique) URL namespace for bucket
- Object key: <path>/<filename>
- S3 access with Permissions or IAM Roles
- Cross-region replication (1 additional region only, otherwise use CloudFront)

### Creating an S3 Bucket
- Create bucket (unique bucket name)
- Amazon Policy Generator tool
- Add Bucket Policy for public access to site assets

### Updating Objects to S3
- Upload objects using Console, CLI or SDK
- `aws s3 cp ...`

### Connecting to S3 with Code
- remove protocol from updated filepaths in source files
- `s3.putObject()` JS SDK

### Working with CORS in S3
- Configure CORS on S3 bucket - target resource (S3 bucket) exists on separate origin than web app requesting the resource

### Accessing S3 with EC2
- EC2 instance needs credentials to access S3 buckets
- Assign IAM Role at EC2 launch configuration level of AMI instance


## A Tale of Two Databases With DynamoDB and RDS
...

### DynamoDB Overview
- Non-relational, NoSQL
- Table -> Items (PK required)
- Provisioned ThroughPut Capacity (4kb units)

### Deciding Between RDS and DynamoDB
- Storage (schema) Flexiblity vs Query Flexibility
- RDS - strict schemas, querying flexibility

### Creating a Table in DynamoDB
- Create a db with a PK

### Connecting to DynamoDB with Code
- Using AWS SDK
- Get all items -  `.scan()` returns upto 1Mb items at a time, call repeatedly to get all items
- Running from EC2 - add permissions to ec2 security role to access RDS and DynamoDb, allow access to RDS from EC2 instance by adding to RDS instance security group

## Automate Your App with Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation

### CloudFormation Overview
- provision resources using templates
- JSON document
- Stacks - create, update, delete
- Tools - CloudFormation designer, CloudFormer

### Provisioning Resources with CloudFormation
- CloudFromation service
- create, test, delete infrastructure stack

### Elastic Beanstalk Overview
- automate application deployment - scaling, monitoring, resource provisioning
- upload code to Elastic Beanstalk - it provisions resources and runs your app
- EB Application - select a platform, has one or more app versions, contains multiple environments

### Deploying an Application with Elastic Beanstalk
- Deployment steps;
  - Manual: upload new code to EC2 instance, create AMI, update Load config, update Auto Scaling Group, terminate out-of-date Instances
  - ELB: Just upload new code ("plant the beanstalk seed")
- Create ELB Application, create Environment (web vs. long-running)
- ELB uses CloudFormation behind-the-scenes

### Configuring an Elastic Beanstalk Env
- Add RDS, DynamoDB, ElasticBeanstalkWebTier access to EC2 Security Group
- Allow access to RDS db from EC2 instance Security Group
- Security changes requires restart of app servers from ELB dashboard

## Speeding Up with CloudFront and ElastiCache
### Introduction
- CloudFront and CloutFront distributation
- Elasticache engine options

### CloudFront Overview
- Improve latency
- Global CDN
- Auto routes requests to closest CloudFront edge to the user
- Integrates with EC2, S3, load balancers
- Edges "Objects" and proxies dynamic content to origin source
- CloudFront Distribution - a set of content edged with CloudFront (assigned a URL), provides content from one or more origins
- CloudFront Distribution Behaviours - caching behaviour based on path

### Edging Your App with CloudFront
- Create a Distribution, set ELB app as origin
- Can add origin custom header
- Customise Object caching
- Setup cookie forwarding
- Set Edge Locations

### Configuring a CloudFront Distribution
- Can add multiple origins to the CloudFront Distribution
- Configure Cache Behaviour by path patterns
- Statistics, reports - e.g. cache hits/misses; popular objects

### ElastiCache Overview
- ElastiCache Cluster
- Redis/Memcached options

### Configuring a Redis Cluster in ElastiCache
- Create Security Group for ElastiCache cluster (port 6379 and ec2 Security Group)
- t2.micro instance available in free tier
- Select VPC to add Redis instance to
- Select Security Group created above

### Interacting with ElastiCache in Code
- Connect directly to Redis Server from web app
- Add Elasticache policy to ec2 Security Group

### Conclusion
- CloudFront and ElastiCache can improve app performance
